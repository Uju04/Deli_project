# **GROUP MEMBERS AND THEIR ROLES.**
<br>
 1. OCHEMBA OBIANUJU ONYINYECHI - BHU/22/04/05/0058.
<br>
- Worked on the Controller aspect of the project for both the item and vehicle. The controller handles the the request and response from the client. Annotations like @GETMAPPING AND @POSTMAPPING. Using the @GETMAPPING to get vehicle by ID, and POSTMAPPING to create item and vehicle.
<br>
- I also used an app called 'postman' which is an API testing and development tool, allowing me to send HTTP request to API and inspect the responses, thus helping connect the backend to the frontend. If postman sends requests successfully to the backend API and receive the expected responses then the backend works well and indicates that any API problem may be from the frontend.

2. Praise Ikenna Onyeaghala- BHU/22/04/05/0092.
<br>
Worked on the Service layer of the project for both Item and Vehicle. The service layer handles the business logic and interactions with the database. Implemented key methods such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting items and vehicles.
<br>
	•	Used Spring annotations like @Service to define service components and integrated them with repositories for database operations.
<br>
	•	Ensured smooth backend functionality by handling requests efficiently and improving exception handling to prevent system failures.
<br>
	•	Used Postman, an API testing and development tool, to send HTTP requests to the backend and inspect responses. This helped validate API functionality and ensure proper backend-to-frontend communication. If Postman successfully sent requests and received expected responses, it indicated that any API issues were likely on the frontend side.
