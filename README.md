- Worked on the Controller aspect of the project. The controller handles the the request and response from the client. Annotations like @GETMAPPING AND @POSTMAPPING.
<br>
- I also used ann app called 'postman' which is an API testing and development tool, allowign me to send HTTP request to API and inspect the responses.
