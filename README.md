- Worked on the Controller aspect of the project for both the item and vehicle. The controller handles the the request and response from the client. Annotations like @GETMAPPING AND @POSTMAPPING.
<br>
- I also used an app called 'postman' which is an API testing and development tool, allowign me to send HTTP request to API and inspect the responses, thus helping connect the backend to the frontend. If postman sends requests successfully to the backend API and receive the expected responses then the backend works well and indicates that any API problem may be from the frontend.
